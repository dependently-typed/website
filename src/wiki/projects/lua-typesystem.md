# Retrofitting a type system onto Lua

Lua is a lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It is quite popular amongst game developers. However, Lua does not have a built-in type system, which can make developing large scale projects difficult. Through this project, we will retrofit a type system onto (a subset) of Lua. 

Technical pre-reqs:

- Familiarity with any dynamic programming language (JavaScript, Python, Ruby for example)
- Familiarity with type systems (can be practical or theoretical)
- C/C++ experience will be helpful
