# Interpreter for Bel

[Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)) developed a specification for a new dialect of Lisp which he named [Bel](http://www.paulgraham.com/bel.html). Through this project we will develop an interpreter for Bel.

Technical pre-reqs:

- Basic knowledge of Lisp
- Some experience with developing interpreters. See [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) for a great introduction
